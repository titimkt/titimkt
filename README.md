### Hi everyone ðŸ‘‹

My name is Thiago and I live in Brazil.

I've been working with Marketing and Graphic Design since 2010 and teaching CorelDRAW, Photoshop and InDesign since 2018 at [Infoserv school](http://escolainfoserv.com.br/). However, I'm changing my career to Web Development, because it's an area I've always liked and is in high demand.

Speaking of Web Development precisely, over the years I have been creating small on-demand websites as a freelancer and currently I have focused on WordPress/Elementor based pages due to the demands of my current job as a digital marketing professional.
